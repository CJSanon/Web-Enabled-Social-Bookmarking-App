## Project Description
A bookmarking web application for bookmarking your favorite books, movies, and online articles. The goal is to grow this project into a social bookmarking application with a large database of media types so I can keep track of my media consumption.

## Project Background

This project is a continuation of the course project for "Java In-Depth: Becoma a Complete Java Engineer!" by Dheeru Mundluru. It is a great project for practicing OOP, learning how to use MVC architecture, incorporating TDD, and exploring Java SE and EE. Won't iterate on this until June/July 2021.

## Technologies
Project is created with:

- Java 15 (this will run with Java 8 as no post-Java 8 features are used.)
- MySQL 8.0
- Apache Tomcat 9.0.41

Readme updates will be in a week or two.
