## Project Description

## Project Background

This project is a continuation of the course project for "Java In-Depth: Becoma a Complete Java Engineer!" by Dheeru Mundluru. It is a great project for practicing OOP, learning how to use MVC architecture, incorporating TDD, and exploring Java SE and EE features. I'm excited to transition this project into something rewardingly unique. 


## Technologies
Project is created with:

- Java 15 (this will run with Java 8 as no post-Java 8 features are used.)
- MySQL 8.0
- Apache Tomcat 9.0.41
